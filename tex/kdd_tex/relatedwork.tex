Our work is most related to cohesive subgraph mining~\cite{durmaz2017frequent, koujaku2016dense, sozio2010community, cui2014local, li2015influential, cui2013online, mcauley2012learning}, such as clique~\cite{bron1973algorithm, rossi2014fast}, k-core~\cite{cheng2011efficient, shin2016corescope}, k-truss~\cite{huang2014querying, wang2012truss, cohen2008trusses, huang2015approximate, huang2016truss} and quasi-clique~\cite{tsourakakis2013denser}. 

The concept of k-truss community based on triangle connectivity is first introduced in~\cite{huang2014querying}.
