\label{conclusion}

In this work, we use information required to process a community query to divide local k-truss community queries into two categories, the \toplevelprob{} query and the \bottomlevelprob{} query. We designed \twolevelindex{} that stores the \treeindex{} in the top level index for locating relevant communities and the \inducedgraph{} in the bottom level index to preserve the triangle connectivity at the edge level inside each k-truss community. 
We proved the effectiveness of our index structure theoretically and experimentally for processing both \toplevelprob{} queries and \bottomlevelprob{} queries with a single query vertex or multiple query vertices. We compared with state-of-the-art methods for single-vertex k-truss community search and showed that our method has the best performance. %Results show our method can process \toplevelprob{} queries in the range of hundreds of micro seconds to less than a second and \bottomlevelprob{} queries from a few seconds to hundreds of seconds for highest degree vertices within large communities.
