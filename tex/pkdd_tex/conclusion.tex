In this paper, given an undirected graph G and a set of query nodes $Q$, we formulate a new problem call truss community identity search, which can help answer various query types with multiple query vertices such as max-k truss query, any-k truss query as well as k-truss query. This new proposed problem can be used in many applications as building blocks for community related queries. To solve this problem and k-truss community search efficiently, we propose a 2-level index structure for fast query process. Not only our index structure can support various query types with multiple query vertices. We ourperform state-of-the-art truss index for single vertex k-truss community search. We also develop an efficient algorithm to construct such an index. Extensive experiments on real-world networks show the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.
