\label{conclusion}

In this work, we designed an two level index structure to solve local community query problem, which is a generalized version of the community search problem. We showed that various types of local community queries can be efficiently processed on our index with a two step procedure, and our procedure is theoretically optimal. We conducted extensive experiments of both the \toplevelprob{} and the \bottomlevelprob{} local k-truss community queries on real-world graphs. Results show that our index structure outperforms the state-of-the-art method, Equitruss and TCP-Index. The performance gain is much noticeable for the \toplevelprob{} queries which can benefit many real-world applications such as team formation and tag suggestion.

%local k-truss community queries into the \toplevelprob{} query and the \bottomlevelprob{} query. 

%We designed \twolevelindex{} that stores the \treeindex{} in the top level index for locating relevant communities and the \inducedgraph{} in the bottom level index to preserve the triangle connectivity at the edge level inside each k-truss community. 
%We showed experimentally that our index structure outperformed state-of-the-art methods.
