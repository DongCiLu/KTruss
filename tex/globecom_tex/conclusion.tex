In this work, we use information required to process a community query to divide local k-truss community queries into two categories, the \toplevelprob{} query and the \bottomlevelprob{} query. We designed \twolevelindex{} that stores the \treeindex{} in the top level index for locating relevant communities and the \inducedgraph{} in the bottom level index to preserve the triangle connectivity at the edge level inside each k-truss community. 
We showed experimentally that our index structure outperformed state-of-the-art methods for processing both \toplevelprob{} queries and \bottomlevelprob{} queries with a single query vertex or multiple query vertices.
